The canonical and most up to date information will be on those systems and this file should always be seen to be superceded by their metadata.

NB this is a large file, and problems using some tools such as ""./jq"" have been reported. The file was created with python's ""json"" module"" and can be opened and used with it. This JSON file can be flattened (with a loss of some qualifying information) into a CSV file using <a href=""https://gist.github.com/benosteen/7dd20109bbdf7716218ba73279c70a3c"">this python script.</a>

That said, the metadata presented here is very useful in connecting the basic metadata of a book with its PDF on the British Library systems, as well as connecting it to the illustrations ""cut"" from its pages and uploaded to Flickr Commons.

The fields are mostly self-explanatory. The difference between 'datefield' and 'date' is that 'datefield' hold the data that was present in the original metadata file, and 'date' is an attempt to coerce this into a useful field to sort on. The 'imgs' field holds the flickr identifiers for all the illustrations cut from this work and uploaded to flickr. (Replace {ID} with the identifier in http://flickr.com/photos/{ID} to go to it). 'imgs' is broken down by volume and then by page. A book that consists of a single volume will only have the ""0"" volume field.

To get the PDF for this work, replace {ID} with the pdf identifier (starts with 'lsid') in http://access.bl.uk/item/pdf/{ID}.

The JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996 - 2013) contains all of the resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in ‘.uk’, or that are required in order to render those UK pages. 

The geoindex dataset is composed of c. 700,641,549 lines of Tab Separated Values (TSV) data, each asserting that a given web page, crawled at a given data, contained one or more references to a given postcode. Uncompressed, this is a total of 61 GB of text, and so care should be taken before downloading or attempting to use this data set.

UKWA,ukwa,UK Selective Web Archive Classification Dataset. 1996 - 2010. TSV. ,"The dataset comprises a manually curated selective archive produced by UKWA which includes the classification of sites into a two-tiered subject hierarchy.

In partnership with the Internet Archive and JISC, UKWA had obtained access to the subset of the Internet Archive’s web collection that relates to the UK. The JISC UK Web Domain Dataset (1996 - 2013) contains all of the resources from the Internet Archive that were hosted on domains ending in ‘.uk’, or that are required in order to render those UK pages.

UKWA have made this manually-generated classification information available as an open dataset in Tab Separated Values (TSV) format. 
UKWA is particularly interested in whether high-level metadata like this can be used to train an appropriate automatic classification system so that this manually generated dataset may be used to partially automate the categorisation of the UKWA’s larger archives. UKWA expects that an appropriate classifier might require more information about each site in order to produce reliable results, and a future goal is to augment this dataset with further information. Options include: for each site, making the titles of every page on that site available, and for each site, extract a set of keywords that summarise the site, via the full-text index.
